unittest-xml-reporting
----------------------

unittest-xml-reporting is a Python unittest-based test runner that can export
test results to JUnit[2] like XML reports.

The usefulness of such a thing becomes clear when we consider the use of
Continous Integration servers (like Cruise Control[3] and Hudson[4]) to
control the build cycle of our applications.

Since most CI servers are able to parse those JUnit XML reports to know
whether a build fails (and display fancy graphics and statistics, of course),
it would be nice if such features could work for regular Python unittest
TestCases.


Installation
------------

If you want to get the latest stable version and have setuptools installed in
your machine, execute the following command to download and install
unittest-xml-reporting:

$ sudo easy_install unittest-xml-reporting

To get the latest *development* version, access the project's website[1] in
GitHub and download the current tarball. If you are familiar to Git, you can
also clone the repository:

$ git clone git://github.com/danielfm/unittest-xml-reporting.git

Once you have downloaded the latest development version, you need to execute
the following command to finish the installation:

$ sudo python setup.py install
